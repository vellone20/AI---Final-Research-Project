The objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of each individual regression model in hopes of finding the best model and comparing it to some of the other models using rings + 1.5 for age as the target value. It illustrates how well a regression models can predict the value of the target variable. Additionally, the test/hold-out sets of the best model are later calculated and compared to another modelâ€™s test/hold-out sets to view simularities and differences between the two. The results yielded the best regressor to be Random Forest Regressor with a tuned R2 value of 0.5457 and a predicted best R2 of 0.7758.
